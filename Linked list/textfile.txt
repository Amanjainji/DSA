This program reads a file line by line, trims the line of leading and trailing whitespace, 
and checks if the line is not empty and
 does not start with a if we're inside a multi-line comment.
 If we encounter a comment, we set the flag and skip the rest of the line.
 If we encounter a comment, we reset the flag.

#Note that this program assumes that the file path is a string literal 
and that the file is in the same directory as the program.
 You may need to modify the program to handle file paths and errors more robustly.
