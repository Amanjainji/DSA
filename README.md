# Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) in C++

This repository contains **topic-wise implementations of Data Structures and Algorithms in C++ , containing all the questions by Love Babbar, Striver A2Z and SDE sheet with Comments**.  
It is designed for **learning, interview preparation, and competitive programming practice**.

All codes are written in **standard C++ (C++14 / C++17)** and organized in a **clean folder structure** so that each topic can be studied independently.

---

## Key Features

- ✅ Topic-wise organized DSA problems
- ✅ Clean and readable C++ code
- ✅ Covers basics to advanced concepts
- ✅ Useful for interviews and competitive programming
- ✅ Inspired by popular sheets (Striver, LeetCode, Love Babbar etc.)
Each folder contains **`.cpp` files** related to that topic.
